# Facial Detection

Description: This project is done to learn more about testing computer vision models, namely bounding boxes. Various models are applied to the Human Faces (Object Detection) dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbaghbidi/human-faces-object-detection). Make sure the images are stored in the archive folder while labels are stored in the root dictionary.
The scripts preprocess the data and train various models on bounding box prediction.

## Installation
Clone the git repo: 
install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
next, choose a model to run

### YOLOv8
All the required scripts are done in the YOLO_mod.py file. Testing the YOLOv8 model is done by running the script that preprocesses the data into YOLO's input format. Weights are stored in the weights folder.  


### RNN and VGG


### Custom model (in progress)
